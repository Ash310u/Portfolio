# **App Name**: Ashutosh Saha Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Parallax Hero Section: Implement a full-screen parallax image sequence in the hero section, controlled by scroll position.  The frames should advance/reverse smoothly when scrolling up/down with no autoplay. All frames will preload.
- Identity Block: Left-aligned text block in the hero section featuring a small intro line, a large editable two-line title (name), and a horizontal row of skill/focus highlights. Users can globally customize the name, tagline, short intro description, and theme accent color.
- Value Proposition: Right-aligned text block in the hero section presenting a subheadline and a supporting paragraph detailing Ashutosh's value proposition. Includes backend, scalable system, and AI-powered products details. This feature should not be AI powered.
- About Section: Showcasing engineering experience in scalable systems and AI. Duotone portrait or abstract AI-generated visual based on description.
- Core Expertise Grid: A grid layout showcasing key areas of expertise, including backend architecture, distributed systems, AI applications, and product engineering. This feature should not be AI powered.
- AI content generation: Tool to generate abstract visuals and modify parts of the website content.
- Theme Customization: Allow users to customize the website, particularly by modifying the parallax hero WebP image sequences and changing the accent color, as well as editing the Name / Brand Title, Professional Tagline / Slogan, and Short Intro Description

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Black/Charcoal backgrounds for a dark mode theme (#121212).
- Accent color: Cinematic neon orange (#FF4500) for buttons, highlight lines, section markers, and hover states.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Minimal, monochrome social icons (YouTube, Instagram, X) in the footer.
- Single-page layout with distinct sections for hero, about, expertise, projects, testimonials, FAQ, CTA, and footer.
- Smooth fade transitions when switching themes, and subtle hover animations on core expertise cards.
- Ensure an engineer-first, performance-oriented visual style that balances minimal design and high-end appeal.
