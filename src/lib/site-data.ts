  aboutShort: "I design and build backend-heavy, performance-oriented systems — from APIs and real-time infrastructure to AI-powered tools and modern web applications.",
  aboutFull: `A software engineer with a sharp focus on backend architecture, APIs, and scalability. My journey began with a strong foundation in C and C++, which has ingrained a performance-first mindset in my engineering approach.

Today, my daily toolkit includes JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, and Next.js. I have hands-on experience architecting and implementing solutions involving WebSockets, Redis, and Pub/Sub systems for real-time data processing.

I am actively exploring the frontier of AI & LLM-powered applications, utilizing Python and LangChain to build intelligent, next-generation systems. As Co-Founder & Engineer at Makrawl, I am focused on creating advanced knowledge retrieval systems that push the boundaries of what's possible.`,
